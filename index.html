            <h1>A Guide for Using a Debit Card at an ATM</h1>
            <br />

            <p>
              You may use your debit card for more than just in-person and
              online purchases. Moreover, you can use it to withdraw money from
              ATMs (ATMs). Some people only use their debit cards to make cash
              withdrawals. You can use an ATM to withdraw money, deposit money,
              check your balance, and more. All of those tasks, with the
              exception of deposits and withdrawals, can also be completed
              online. Keep in mind the following
            </p>

            <h2>Safety first</h2>
            <p>
              Check to see if using an ATM is safe before you do so. Use ATMs
              only in pristine, well-lit areas. Thieves occasionally wait around
              for individuals who have plainly just withdrew cash. Check the ATM
              for any suspicious-looking items. On ATMs, thieves can install
              covert skimming equipment. These tools are capable of stealing
              your card information, and there may even be covert cameras nearby
              that can catch you entering your PIN. Use another ATM if anything
              seems off.
            </p>

            <h2>
              Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What should I do since the ATM
              didn't give me money?
            </h2>
            <p>
              Make sure to note the time and location of any ATM failures that
              prevent you from receiving the requested amount of cash.
              Frequently, a defect is detected by the system itself, so you
              won't need to take any action to correct it. However, you might
              have to get in touch with the bank and submit a claim.
            </p>

            <h2>Is it secure to use the ATM to deposit money?</h2>
            <p>
              Although problems may occasionally happen, ATMs are generally
              secure and trustworthy for depositing money into your account. It
              is advised that you make the deposit with a teller if it is
              significant in order to prevent any errors.
